# trial
My first trial on GitHub

And it starts with uploading my Electroneum miner script.

The script is for (Ubuntu) Linux and expects 0, 1 or 2 parameters.

First parameter is the name of the mining pool. Randomly chosen names, not really logical. I guess I can put them here.

Second parameter is the number of threads the mining program will use.

The script uses the xmrig mining software right now, that I just downloaded from GitHub and compiled to the normal location.

Location of the mining program is ~/git/xmrig/build/xmrig, just as per compile instructions.

Of course the script can be made much nicer, including choosing a miner program and such.

And please forgive me being a newbie with bash/Linux scripts. I am pretty sure there may be a switch statement or something. I just needed to learn the basics first, like how to create a condition, which I figured out a bit now.
